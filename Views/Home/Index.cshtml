                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world. It's important to DocketEagle to help our subscribers/clients retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.</p>
                <p>We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you and to us. So, we'll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, DocketEagle follows different principles in accordance with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We won’t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address, or any other information to anyone.</li>
                    <li>We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Notice</h6>
                <p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a Registration ID on the site or when you download free software, enter a contest, order email newsletters, or join a limited-access premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
                    <li>To help you quickly find software, services, or information.</li>
                    <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
                    <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and other new services from DocketEagle.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Consent</h6>
                <p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you cannot use most of DocketEagle services. And you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>
                <p>If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like docket updates and our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding DocketEagle products, programs, events, or services by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from DocketEagle.</p>

                <h6>Access</h6>
                <p>We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at your dashboard. There, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>View and edit personal information you have already given us.</li>
                    <li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.</li>
                    <li>Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again. Wherever you go on DocketEagle, your information stays with you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Security</h6>
                <p>DocketEagle has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
                <p>We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and secure. When you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing secure server software SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available.</p>

                <h6>Notice to Parents</h6>
                <p>Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children's privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet.</p>
                <p>The DocketEagle site does not publish content that is targeted to children. However, if you are concerned about your children providing DocketEagle any personal information without your consent, do not allow your children to use DocketEagle services. Remember no subscriber under the age of 18 can register for DocketEagle services.</p>

                <h6>Enforcement</h6>
                <p>If for some reason you believe DocketEagle has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at docketeagle@gmail.com, and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.</p>

                <h6>Electronic Product Registration</h6>
                <p>When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information.</p>

                <h6>What We Do With the Information You Share</h6>
                <p>When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service, and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer.</p>
                <p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering client questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration.</p>

                <h6>Disclosure of Information</h6>
                <p>DocketEagle will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
                <ul>
